# CalorieCrunch-XGBoost-Fitness-Meter

This project aims to predict exercise-related calorie burn using an XGBoost regressor, focusing on creating a precise regression model.  

##Data Analysis:  

The initial analysis involves a heatmap for visualizing variable correlations, aiding in identifying key predictors and enhancing feature selection.  

##Libraries and Tools:  

Python's NumPy and Pandas libraries handle data manipulation, while matplotlib and seaborn facilitate visualization.  

##Results and XGBoost:  

The process includes data splitting, XGBoost regressor training, and evaluation. The model's efficacy is evaluated using the R-squared value.  
The XGBoost model achieves an impressive 98% R-squared value, indicating its capability to accurately estimate calorie burn.
